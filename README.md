# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to use our knowledge of JavaScript and HTML to create a map along with Leaflet.js API that showcases earthquake data all over the world. To create the map, 3 different map tile layers, a streets view, satellite streets view, and a dark view. Different overlays have also been added to the map to showcase the general  earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes using d3.json() and geoJSON layer. Once the map is loaded on a server, one can select and deselect overlay options depending on which data wants to be looke at.
